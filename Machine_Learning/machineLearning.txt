MACHINE LEARNING - 1.SUPERVISED 2.UNSUPERVISED 3.REINFORCEMENT

1.SUPERVISED LEARNING -when we have to predict the dependent column on the basis of independent column (like marks is a dependent column from (name, class, gender, marks))
types of supervised - 1.regression(y ka nature continous) 2.classification(y ka nature discrete)



2.UNSUPERVISED LEARNING - 

unlabelled data (raw data) - algo(machine) - classes or groups

1.Clustering Analysis (Grouping)

algo - KMeans



3.REINFORCEMENT LEARNING - during the prediction or processing it correct itself. it check that what it is doing is coreect or not and correect it by going backwards.


Real lofe applications of ML
1.sales prediction
2.spam and ham classification







SUPERVISED LEARNING - 
REGRESSION (if y variable has a continous nature)- 
            1.linear regression
            2.decision tree
            3.random forest regression
            4.KNN
            5.SVM

CLASSIFICATION (if y variable has a discrete nature) - 
            1.logistic Regression
            2.decision tree
            3.random forest classification
            4.KMM
            5.SVM
            6.Naive Bayes



Note : data preparation :- 
                gathering data
                analysi data (EDA- exploratory data Analysis) and data cleaning
                remove duplicate data
                remove missing data records (rows or columns) or filling the records.
                pre-processing
                Data transformation - convert categorical to numerical
                            # categorical => Numerical
                            # 1.label encoding  - lables(numeric value)
                            # 2.onehot encoding - (categorical into numeric value but using 0 and 1 only)
                            # 3.ordinal encoding - ()
                            # assign values 1,2,3,4 to the values which are not in numeric datatype in owner.
                x,y
                train algo
                test algo

                            # trainingg score and testing score me jiska score difference 5 ya 5 se kam ho to vo best he
                            # 
                            # over fit 
                            # (training score high (91), testing score low (81))
                            # under fit (training score )
                            # (training score low , testing store unknown (may be high or low))
